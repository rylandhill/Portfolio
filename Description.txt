Hello Admissions officer! I appreciate you taking your time to check out this github as I have dedicated a lot of time to programming, especially some of the code in this github so you looking at it would mean a lot to me. I have 2 folders in this github, one is made up of some projects I have made for school across the last few years, and another is a collection of programs I have made for a website called "Advent of Code". This is an event ran each year in december and each day a new puzzle is introduced that is intended to be solved with code. This was initially shown to me by my 10th grade computer science teacher and I have spent a large amount of time on many of these puzzles. I have added a few of the more difficult ones I completed, labeled by year and day, the initial problem can be found at adventofcode.com.
I also found an old project from 7th grade, this would be 5 years old at this point but it is the oldest code I have written https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/1KnzueNCPAteWnF2D74HQ6uva5iQCiyzxcrP4D73VMY
